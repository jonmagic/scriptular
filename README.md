Scriptular
==========

A regular expression editor for javascript.

## Backstory

Before the summer of 2011 I never took the time to dig into regular expressions and actually learn how they work. Then [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) came along and suddenly regular expressions were cool.

Immediately I began writing hubot scripts and started using [Rubular](http://rubular.com) to test my regular expressions. Unforunately there are some differences between regular expressions in Ruby and javascript.

So I created [Scriptular](http://scriptular.com) and started regular expressing myself ;)
